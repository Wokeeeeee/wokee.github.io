<p>In the UAV Challenge, drones are required to complete tasks such as autonomous flight, trajectory planning, target identification, positioning, and motion planning. Our team participated in this competition in 2020 and 2022. And  In the winter of 2020, we got 2nd prize.</p>

<p><strong>My work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I led in <strong>the coding of strategy part</strong>. We encapsulate the aircraft’s actions from the bottom up, from the adjustment of altitude and position to the delivery and navigation tasks. We combine the navigation information, flight control information, and visual information from the interface to make a strategy choice while fitting the logic of the mission.</li>
<li>I built a <strong>simulation platform on Gazebo</strong>. I am skilled in the use of gazebo and the preparation of sdf files. I added and adjusted the sensor devices to the aircraft in the simulation environment and built the coordinate system transformation in it. This simulation environment played a big role in our competition debugging process, because the actual flight of the aircraft needs to be operated by human beings and will face the risk of crashing and collision, so we have conducted a lot of tests in this simulation environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have just finished the UAV Challenge in 2022, which has more difficulty in the rules and more teams. The results have not yet been announced, but we have made great progress compared to the previous.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, unlike other teams, the structural design and assembly control of our aircraft are done by our team members themselves. So each of us has the basic ability to judge the problems that occur during the flight. Even if I’m not well-skilled, I learned to <strong>operate the drone manually!!!</strong></p>
<h4 id="a-web-site-platform-for-drone-control"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#a-web-site-platform-for-drone-control"></a> A Web-site Platform for Drone Control</h4>
<p>This is a web-side platform for planning the behavioral actions of the drone when <strong>flying autonomously</strong>. Using web-side control can eliminate the trouble of environment configuration, and there is <strong>no need to recompile</strong> the web-side after setting the behavioral target, and it can take off after pressing the button.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Wokeeeeee/picb/blob/master/platform.jpg?raw=true" width="50%" ></img></p>
<p><strong>My work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I am responsible for <strong>encapsulating the underlying behavior</strong> of the aircraft to facilitate front-end call selection.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate with the front-end code through GRPC</strong>, pass the received messages to the ROS node, and write the interfaces to receive action messages at the control node.</li>
</ol>
<p>This platform has also applied for <strong>the Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program</strong>. It can really be used in real flight scenarios, and it has helped us in a drone competition in 2021 to eliminate the need to write code logic and to visualize the programming directly to achieve our goals. We have also positioned it as a supplementary education platform that can be very helpful to new aircraft operators or new aircraft system developers to know what they are doing.</p>

<p>A web page can realize the management of departments and department personnel and the functions of work checkin, leave application and approval.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Wokeeeeee/picb/blob/master/fairyhr.png?raw=true" width="50%" ></img></p>
<p><strong>My work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I wrote part of the front-end interface code, mainly html, css, bootstraps layout.</li>
<li>The back-end running logic part of the code. Compared to the last web project using the front and back-end separation method, this project is the use of jsp language, and front and back end is not separated. In order to achieve static local update of web pages in the development process, I also learned the basic use of ajax and js.</li>

<p>It is the work of our primary development course. We decided to make a dungeon game like this because we like rpg games and we played a game called Tower of Mordor when we were kids. And it developed based on JAVAFX, a java game engine.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/FairySoftware/FairyRogue/raw/master/README/screenshot_gaming.png" width="50%" ></img></p>
<p><strong>My work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Part of the game logic code writing. After deciding on the functions and properties of the characters and props, I was involved in writing and debugging some of the logic.</li>
<li>Designing plots and paths and drawing maps. I designed the entire game’s plot and the route, and players can keep trying to find one or two possible routes and some game eggs that I left out.</li>
<li>Some gadgets are written, such as item properties, blood box display and other widgets.</li>
